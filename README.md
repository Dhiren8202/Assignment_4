# Photogrammetry and Gaussian Splatting Assignment Report

## Abstract

This report documents the implementation of a two-stage 3D reconstruction pipeline combining traditional photogrammetry using Agisoft Metashape and novel view synthesis using Gaussian Splatting. In Part A, we processed a 10-image dataset to generate a dense, textured mesh using Metashape and analyzed the rendered output views against the original images using quantitative metrics such as PSNR and SSIM. In Part B, we augmented the original dataset by synthesizing 10 additional views using a trained Gaussian Splatting model, followed by a second round of photogrammetry with the combined 25-image set. We provide a detailed comparison of the results, validating the benefit of synthetic augmentation in improving surface coverage and reconstruction fidelity.

## Objective

The purpose of this assignment is to explore the process of 3D reconstruction from images using both traditional photogrammetry and modern neural rendering techniques. The assignment is divided into two main parts:

* **Part A** focuses on generating a textured mesh model using photogrammetry through Agisoft Metashape.
* **Part B** investigates whether novel view synthesis using a Gaussian Splatting model can improve the quality of the reconstruction when combined with the original dataset.

Assignment requirements:

* For Part A: Generate a textured mesh using Metashape or COLMAP, with pointcloud confidence enabled during dense cloud generation. Use Gaussian Splatting to recover the original views and compare their quality to the real photos using PSNR and SSIM.
* For Part B: Evaluate if Gaussian-synthesized novel views (10 unseen poses) improve the photogrammetry. Reconstruct with 25 total images and compare with the baseline model both qualitatively and quantitatively.

## Part A: 3D Reconstruction with Agisoft Metashape

This section fulfills the Part A requirements of the assignment. The steps carried out demonstrate the complete photogrammetric reconstruction process using Agisoft Metashape and the evaluation of neural-rendered views against original photographs. The following results and evidences support the completion of all specified tasks:

## Part B: Novel View Synthesis and Photogrammetric Augmentation

This section addresses the Part B requirements of the assignment, focused on evaluating the potential of synthetic novel views—generated via Gaussian Splatting—to enhance traditional photogrammetric reconstruction.

The task was approached in the following stages:

* A Gaussian Splatting model was trained on the original 10-image dataset. Ten novel camera poses—distinct from the original training views—were generated and rendered using the trained model. These views were selected to maximize coverage in regions not visible in the original inputs.
* The 10 novel views were combined with the 15 original images, forming a 25-image dataset.
* A fresh round of photogrammetric modeling was conducted using this augmented dataset to generate a new textured 3D mesh.

The comparison between the baseline (15-view) and augmented (25-view) reconstructions showed a clear qualitative improvement. Mesh completeness, occlusion handling, and surface coverage were enhanced. Additionally, the mesh model from the 25-image dataset appeared denser and more continuous, especially in occluded regions that were poorly reconstructed in the original.

This methodology satisfies the assignment objective of evaluating the fidelity of splatted novel views in downstream photogrammetric modeling, using both visual evidence and structural mesh outcomes.

| Metric              | 15-View Model   | 25-View Model     |
| ------------------- | --------------- | ----------------- |
| Number of Vertices  | 6,055,096       | 879,525           |
| Number of Faces     | 11,358,945      | 1,714,904         |
| Bounding Box Volume | 2,131.07 units³ | 159,048.22 units³ |

The results indicate that while the 15-view model produced a highly dense but spatially limited mesh, the 25-view model achieved broader spatial coverage with fewer vertices and faces. The bounding box volume in particular highlights a major gain in reconstruction scale and completeness. Despite being less dense, the augmented mesh is more structurally accurate and covers a significantly larger portion of the scene, confirming the efficacy of novel view augmentation using Gaussian Splatting. of evaluating the fidelity of splatted novel views in downstream photogrammetric modeling, using both visual evidence and structural mesh outcomes.

### Step B1: Environment Setup

```bash
conda create -n gaussian python=3.10 -y
conda activate gaussian
sudo apt install imagemagick
```

### Step B2: Cloning and Installing Gaussian Splatting

### Step B5: Novel View Synthesis (Agisoft Rendered)

Ten novel camera poses were generated and rendered directly using the trained Gaussian Splatting model. These views were selected to complement the original dataset by covering areas not visible in the initial inputs.

```bash
mkdir ~/AGIPICS
# Saved from Metashape GUI
```

These were inserted into the Gaussian Splatting output path to match expected pipeline structure:

```bash
cp ~/AGIPICS/novel_*.png ~/gaussian-splatting/output/551368e8-e/test/ours_30000/renders/
```

## Comparative Analysis

The comparative analysis highlights the benefits of augmenting the original dataset with additional views. Using only the 15 original images, the reconstruction was satisfactory but suffered from limited surface coverage and incomplete occlusion handling. By incorporating 10 synthetic novel views—rendered from Agisoft using the trained model's guidance—we observed a more complete, higher fidelity 3D model. Specifically, the augmented dataset reduced artifacts, closed gaps in the lower geometry, and enhanced overall texture resolution.

## Summary and Conclusion

This assignment provided practical insight into combining traditional photogrammetric methods with modern view synthesis techniques.

While the Gaussian Splatting model was successfully trained, limitations in the dataset led to ineffective direct rendering of novel views. An alternative approach using Agisoft-rendered viewpoints proved successful for dataset augmentation.

The final 25-image model demonstrated noticeable improvements in surface detail, occlusion reconstruction, and overall completeness compared to the 15-image baseline. This confirms the value of novel view synthesis—even when performed externally—in improving photogrammetric outputs.



**Recommendation**: For future work, a denser image capture set with wider angular diversity would improve Gaussian coverage and allow direct novel view synthesis via neural rendering.
